# Neural Network + Kalman Filter for stock prices

## Introduction
The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Kalman Filter in enhancing the performance of specific machine learning models. The study will focus on the application of these models in stock price prediction.

It is commonly known that predicting stock prices may be challenging and yet frustrating - mainly due to vast amount of variables which influence the target value. I was never particularly interested in stock market itself, let alone how it works, until recently. My motivation behind creation of this study is to develop some more profound idea of how stock market works and also to connect it with something I am deeply into (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.). 

In order to achieve main goal of this research I will create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), evaluate its scores and compare them with the same model but fed with filtered data.

### Hypothesis
Since these solutions are already utilized in real-world scenarios, my contention is that Kalman Filter will improve overall model performance.
